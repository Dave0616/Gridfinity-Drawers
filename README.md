Im New at this so im still working on some stuff

These are here so you can make your own gridfinity drawers, the Freecad files are semi parametric? you can change the size settings in the spreadsheet in each part and this is very important, any size is for the inside of the drawer, if you want a 4x4 grid with 60mm of inner drawer space than that is whate you put in for EVERY spreadsheet!

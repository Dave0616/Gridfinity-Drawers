Im New at this so im still working on some stuff

These are here so you can make your own gridfinity drawers, the Freecad files are semi parametric? you can change the size settings in the spreadsheet in each part and this is very important, any size is for the inside of the drawer, if you want a 4x4 grid with 60mm of inner drawer space than that is whate you put in for EVERY spreadsheet! If your drawer is 60mm high than in the vertical supports and guide put 60mm, horizantal support, if you drawer is 4 deep than put 4, all of the files will andjust for you.


I have not made every size In have listed (I have mde 5x5s 4x4s 2x4s)
I uploaded an example image, you dont need to make a stack you can just make a single drawer
The stack example does not show the rear V and X braces
the image also dowsnt show the drawers yet, Ill try to upload a pic at some point, there are drawers with badges and without badges
